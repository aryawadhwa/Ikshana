# Accessibility-Enhanced Smart Glasses for Visual Impairment

## Modified Hardware Components

### Additional Components Needed
- Higher quality microphone array for better voice recognition
- Bone conduction headphones (safer than regular headphones as they don't block environmental sounds)
- Distance sensors (2-3 ultrasonic sensors) for obstacle detection
- Optional: GPS module for location awareness
- Higher capacity battery (2000mAh minimum) to support additional sensors
- Camera with higher resolution and better low-light performance

### Hardware Modifications
1. Replace standard microphone with microphone array
   - Enables better voice command recognition
   - Allows for directional sound detection
   
2. Add ultrasonic sensors
   - Mount sensors at different angles (front, left, right)
   - Enables obstacle detection and distance measurement
   - Helps with spatial awareness

3. Upgrade the camera system
   - Use higher resolution camera module
   - Add infrared capabilities for better performance in various lighting conditions
   - Position for optimal field of view

## Software Enhancements

### Core Accessibility Features
1. Object Detection and Recognition
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input

class ObjectDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_model('mobilenet_v2_model.h5')
        self.labels = self.load_labels()
    
    def detect_objects(self, frame):
        processed_frame = preprocess_input(frame)
        predictions = self.model.predict(processed_frame)
        detected_objects = self.process_predictions(predictions)
        return detected_objects
    
    def announce_objects(self, objects, text_to_speech):
        for obj in objects:
            text_to_speech.speak(f"{obj.name} detected at {obj.position}")
```

2. Text Recognition and Reading
```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

class TextReader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tesseract = pytesseract
    
    def read_text(self, frame):
        text = self.tesseract.image_to_string(Image.fromarray(frame))
        return text
    
    def process_text(self, text, text_to_speech):
        if text:
            text_to_speech.speak(f"Found text: {text}")
```

3. Distance Warning System
```python
class DistanceWarning:
    def __init__(self, threshold_cm=100):
        self.threshold = threshold_cm
        self.sensors = self.initialize_sensors()
    
    def check_distances(self):
        distances = []
        for sensor in self.sensors:
            distance = sensor.measure_distance()
            distances.append(distance)
        return distances
    
    def warn_if_close(self, distances, text_to_speech):
        for direction, distance in enumerate(distances):
            if distance < self.threshold:
                direction_name = ['front', 'left', 'right'][direction]
                text_to_speech.speak(f"Warning: Object {distance}cm {direction_name}")
```

### Voice Command Interface
```python
import speech_recognition as sr

class VoiceInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        self.commands = {
            "read": self.trigger_text_reading,
            "describe": self.trigger_scene_description,
            "locate": self.trigger_object_location
        }
    
    def listen_for_commands(self):
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            audio = self.recognizer.listen(source)
            try:
                command = self.recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
                self.process_command(command)
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                self.speak("Sorry, I didn't catch that")
```

## User Interface Modifications

1. Replace visual display with audio feedback
2. Implement haptic feedback for navigation
3. Add voice-activated controls for all functions
4. Include emergency assistance features
5. Implement different audio patterns for different types of warnings

## Safety Features

1. Battery level voice notifications
2. Emergency contact system
3. Fall detection
4. Location tracking and sharing
5. Automatic obstacle avoidance warnings

## Assembly Considerations

1. Ensure all components are securely mounted
2. Optimize weight distribution for comfort
3. Make battery easily replaceable
4. Include backup power system
5. Ensure all wiring is properly insulated and protected

## Usage Instructions

1. Voice Commands:
   - "Read text" - Activates text recognition
   - "Describe scene" - Provides scene description
   - "Identify objects" - Lists detected objects
   - "Distance check" - Reports nearby obstacles
   - "Location" - Provides current location
   - "Battery status" - Reports remaining battery life

2. Maintenance:
   - Regular cleaning of sensors and camera
   - Battery replacement procedure
   - System updates and calibration
